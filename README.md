# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Get a value from the user

### Step 2:
Assign the values

### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)

### Step 4: 
Print the results

### Step 5: 
End the program

### PROGRAM:
 ```python

import math as m
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=m.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```

### OUTPUT:
